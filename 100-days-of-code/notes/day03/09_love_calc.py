# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
# To work out the love score between two people:
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
# "Your score is **z**."

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇

name = name1.lower() + name2.lower()

digit1 = name.count("t") + name.count("r") + name.count("u") + name.count("e")
digit2 = name.count("l") + name.count("o") + name.count("v") + name.count("e")

love_score = digit1 * 10 + digit2

if (love_score < 10) or (love_score > 90):
    print(f"Your score is {love_score}, you go together like coke and mentos.")
elif (love_score > 40) and (love_score < 50):
    print(f"Your score is {love_score}, you are alright together.")
else:
    print(f"Your score is {love_score}.")
