# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m)
# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
# Convert height and weight to float
# Calculate BMI
bmi_value = float(weight) / float(height) ** 2
# Print BMI value as an integrer
print(int(bmi_value))
